      title: 'How It Works?',
      description: '<p>Each pool now is a single-side pool which contains a token and an anchor. The anchor is usually defined as a virtual stable token in each pool. Based on this, the protocol computes the value of reserve and the marginal price. Concretely, when the anchor has value of $1, the value of reserve is identical to the number of anchors.</p><p> The marginal price is equal to the number of anchors divided by the reserve. These indicators is not only for market evaluation but also for constructing key formulae in SenSwap. In practice, SenSwap will make use of quick block confirmation time based on Proof-of-History on Solana to alleviate the front-run attack, and low fee for user attraction</p>',
